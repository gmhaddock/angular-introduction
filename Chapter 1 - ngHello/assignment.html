      <h1>Your assignment:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Initialize this app with the <code>ng-app</code> directive. Call the application: "ngFirst"</li>
        <li>Using a CDN, add a script tag with the source to AngularJS. <strong>Not 2.0</strong></li>
        <li>Using a CDN, a  link tag with a reference to Bootstrap.</li>
        <li> In the content area, add three inputs that users will use to interact with your application.
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Favorite Color</li>
              <li>Email Address</li>
            </ul>
            Use the comments in this HTML file to guide your development.
        </li>
        <li>In the output portion, have the output look something like the following:
          <p>Hello <em>[name]</em> at <em>[emailAddress]!</em> <br>
            I hear your favorite color is <em>[favoriteColor]</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The italics are not necessary in your output, I used them to <em>emphasize</em>
            the dynamic parts of the output.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Since this only needs a single controller, then add the conroller <code>AssignmentController</code>
            to the body of this application.
        </li>
        <li>Inside the controller, you want to create three variables are that are attached
          to the <code>$scope</code> of <code>AssignmentController</code> so that you can use them.
          <ul>
            <li>This is technically not necessary for this simple app. However, this becomes a common
                usage so we might as well get started.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Using the ng-click directive (you may have to look it up), have
            an alert pop up when you click a button called "Woot!". <strong>You must use the Angular way.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>I would add the button using HTML</li>
              <li>You will need to attach a function to the scope of the controller to accomplish this.
                  Call the function <code>sayWoot()</code>.
              </li>
              <li><em>If you do not get this finish, that is okay. If you do, then great.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
