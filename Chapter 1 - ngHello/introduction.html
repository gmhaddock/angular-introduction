    <h1>Welcome to AngularJS!</h1>
    <h3>What is AngularJS?</h3>
    <p>
      That is a great question. This is a tool that was originally developed by Google to address
      some of the shortcomings of building projects with standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript. If you remember,
      manipulating the DOM with jQuery, though easier than standard JavaScript, was still difficult. Dynamically
      adding elements and manipulating those elements based on user interactions was a giant pain. There are several
      frameworks that were devised to lessen these struggles. Some of the frameworks are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Backbone.js</li>
        <li>Ember.js</li>
        <li>AngularJS</li>
      </ul>
      Angular was devised as a way to be data driven and address some of the issues that you will have
      when trying to grab user interaction data and use it to complete some task. Moreover, it allows
      you to modularize the functionality of your web application so that you can reuse code as well as
      fine tune different parts of the application.
    </p>
    <h3>Why are we using AngularJS?</h3>
    <p>We have chosen to use AngularJS as our front-end framework because...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Angular has a small learning curve to get started...
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Careful:</strong>Angular is expansive and will take some time to learn
            the advance features.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Angular is a Model-View-Controller(MVC) framework. This is a design pattern
          that requires you to separate all of your data from the view with a "middle man" called the
          controller that provides the connection and logic for rendering views from the data.
      </li>
      <li>There are a great deal of resources for Angular. (Some are better than others.)</li>
      <li>Pretty much if you can dream it, then you can do it in Angular.</li>
      <li>There are a great many other reasons to use Angular, but I think we shouldn't overwhelm
        ourselves with jargon!
      </li>
    </ul>

    This is a strong simplification of what is going on, but we will use that definition for now.

      of an application. By keeping things simple then we can more easily troubleshoot. -->
